            <h2>1. Difference Between map, filter, find & forEach</h2>
            <p>Answer: These 4 methods are from the ES6. What map does is, it takes an array and loop through that array and returns a new array without changing the original array. Filter uses a callback function which returns true or false on the basis of the conditions and gives the first result within that array. I.E. filter takes an array, [1,2,3,4,5,6,10] and the condition is number is > 4, then using filter method the loops through the numbers and whenever the condition is satisfied, the outcome will be 5 rather than 5,6,10 as 5 the larger and it is the first element after 4. However, by using Filter method, this can be overcame. What filter does is, it works the opposite way of find. Filter loop throughs all the elements and puts all that elements which satisfied the condition into a new array. Therefore, the original array isn't changed. On the other hand, forEach method uses a callback function by looping through every single element of the given array. As it's working principle is similar to map method, however, it does not return any array and will return a "undefined" value. It allows to modify the original array by iterating and satisfying the given conditions.  </p>
