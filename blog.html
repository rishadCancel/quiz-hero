            <h2 class="mt-2 text-3xl">1. Difference Between map, filter, find & forEach</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-xl">Answer: These 4 methods are from the ES6. What map does is, it takes an array and loop through that array and returns a new array without changing the original array. Filter uses a callback function which returns true or false on the basis of the conditions and gives the first result within that array. I.E. filter takes an array, [1,2,3,4,5,6,10] and the condition is number is > 4, then using filter method the loops through the numbers and whenever the condition is satisfied, the outcome will be 5 rather than 5,6,10 as 5 the larger and it is the first element after 4. However, by using Filter method, this can be overcame. What filter does is, it works the opposite way of find. Filter loop throughs all the elements and puts all that elements which satisfied the condition into a new array. Therefore, the original array isn't changed. On the other hand, forEach method uses a callback function by looping through every single element of the given array. As it's working principle is similar to map method, however, it does not return any array and will return a "undefined" value. It allows to modify the original array by iterating and satisfying the given conditions.  </p>

            <h2 class="mt-2 text-3xl">2. Difference between local storage, session storage & cookies</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-xl">Answer: Local storage, session storage and cookies are types of storages in browsers. In local storage dota can be saved without any expiration date and this data does not get removed when the browser is closed or the session is terminated. However, in session storage, data can be saved only for a session and if the session is terminated, the data will not be accessible for future events. On the other hand, cookies can be set for a period of time according to the user and can be removed whenever wished or within a time range. Cookies can hold a fairly low amount of data compared to the other two.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-2 text-3xl">3. What is Event Loop? How does it work?</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-xl">Answer: Javascript is a single threaded programming language which means it can execute one line of code at a time. Suppose, we have multiple functions, inside of those we have multiple statements to execute. So when a function is called, it checks the one line of that function at a time and executes it. However, if within that function(example: function x), if there is another function (example function y), the y function gets executed before all the other statements get executed within function x. When all the statements gets executed in function y, then the code returns to function x after the line of function y and executes other statements of function x. This whole process is called Event Loop. </p>
            <h2 class="mt-2 text-3xl">4. Explain the following functions:</h2>
            <h3 class="mt-2 text-3xl">4.1 quizTimer</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-xl">Answer: The quizTimer function is a time function which shows the time. In the meantime, the setInterval function, there is a variable called count and it gets incremented every second. If the timer goes over 60 seconds, then the timer color get changed in every two seconds.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-2 text-3xl">4.2 chooseQuiz</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-xl">Answer: In the chooseQuiz function, there are two parameter called index and givenAnswer. What this function does is, it checks the if the given answer id is within provided answer id's and calls the display function.</p>
